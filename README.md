HELLO

THIS IS THE THIRD TASK FROM THE NODE.JS BACKEND TRACK IN THE ZURI TRAINING.

I created a simple express application that:
1. Connects to a database
2. Creates the payload: 
{ message: String, data: Object }
This means you are to return an object containing a message that tells the client if the request is successful or not, and data object containing your result.
If there's an error in the request, the response should return the error message instead.
3. Get's the data created
4. Updates the data created
5. Deletes the data created

The data you are required to create should contain name, email and country
